# Intel Tool

This is a project I worked on a while back which was used for gathering intelligence on enemy EVE corporations and alliances in lowsec. Information is scraped from the killboard and then processed through a number of reports, outputing information about enemy activity and effectiveness levels over time.
There is also an economic portion to this if you are interested in playing the lowsec market. A report was designed to get the top number of items lost in a region. By identifying the most used items in different categories and importing them it is possible to make a nice profit.
